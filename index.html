of Face Reading</h2>
<h3 id="research-question">Research question</h3>
<p>How does the human face act as a communication tool in the
intersection with the semiotics and semiology of Chinese theater? This
question is being answered in the framework of a visitation to a face
reader.</p>
<h3 id="plot--allegories-in-the-face-saloon">Plot — “Allegories in the
Face Saloon”</h3>
<p>The first person perspective (the audience) remembers an instance,
where a colleague explained his first encounter with a woman, shrimp
lady. He recounts how this colleague, office gnome, put emphasis on the
facial structure of the lady and the correlation of this to her foul
personality traits, all interpreted through a first glance. The first
person perspective’s interest is piqued and decides to visit a seer in a
face reading shop to learn more about the estranging world of the
theatrics of face reading.</p>
<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>Inspired by theater scripts, this thesis will be narrated through
four characters, each representing a different archetype in Chinese
Opera. The office gnome is represented by Cao Cao, the penultimate grand
chancellor of the Eastern Han dynasty, often given white facial makeup
to reflect his treacherous personality. The shrimp lady stands as the
clown archetype, the comic of the piece, who often uses colloquial
language. The seer, who owns the shop, is represented by the judge
character. The audience lives vicariously through the first person
perspective in the story, represented by the face reading chart. The
audience discovers together with the seer philosophy and theory around
the semantics and semiotics of theater, but will also delve deeper into
concepts such as dramaturgy and performativity. I’m using a theoretic
framework from Steward Hall, Roland Barthes, Goffman Erving and Judith
Butler.</p>

<p>::: ### The Storefront (1st person POV)
{#the-storefront-1st-person-pov } The storefront, a big glass window
decorated with bright rainbow LED fairy lights. The curtains, semi
transparant. The display window, filled with acupuncture models, a big
A1 portrait face reading poster with sloppy typography and a magenta
plasma ball shaped into the Buddha’s head. The tone and the atmosphere
is set. When I enter the shop, I hear the sound of wind chimes
resonating through the space. The only two other sounds I could hear was
the humming of a little minibar sticking out from the small reception
desk and the ticking of an elegant antic wooden pendulum clock.</p>
<h3 id="office-gnome-cao-cao">Office Gnome (Cao Cao)</h3>
<p>Ever since I heard my colleague tell me how he disliked this lady he
met at church upon first glance, I was intrigued why he would make such
a resolute judgement. The sentence I remember, was something along the
lines of “Her face isn’t too auspicious.” It got me curious to find out
what is so unlucky about this person’s face. Are we speaking of pretty
privilege and how owning a conventionally unattractive face would lend
you to a harsher treatment by others or is it just a euphemism to
shadily say the same thing “She’s a shrimp. A seafood, mostly consumed
for their meat, but their head is discarded right into the trash bin. In
other words. She’s unlucky to be born with such a unpleasant face.”</p>
<h3 id="shrimp-lady-clown">Shrimp Lady (Clown)</h3>
<p>However, when I finally met this lady from the church, I was
perplexed, why he’d deem her un-beautiful. She is actually ticking all
the boxes of a gorgeous woman. She has plump lips, big eyes, a beauty
mark on her left eyelid and stern eyebrows. The only thing I could
imagine not conforming to his standards would be that her jawline is
slightly too big for her face. I don’t mind a strong jawline… I saw a
shadow move through the hallway towards the main area, making the bead
curtain going click-clack.</p>
<h3 id="the-seer-daoist-monk">The Seer (Daoist Monk)</h3>
<p>A man in his mid 40s made his way to the reception desk, slouching
the slippers along the black and white tiled floor. Halfway through his
walk, he noticed where I was standing and waved his long fingered hands
at me. “Hello, how could I help you out?” I noticed he had a black
tattoo of a Peking opera performer on his wrist. A face that showed
dominance, as if he holds authority. Dooming and stern. Judgement
day.</p>
<h3 id="the-face">The Face</h3>
<p>A face. An animal’s front side of the head, where the eyes, nose,
mouth are located. Together with an organism’s butthole, it’s one of the
most fundamental body parts our animal species have been developing over
the past millions of years. No wonder linguistically and etymologically,
the term ‘face’ has the following different meanings. The face of the
mountain (front side something). Losing face (losing one’s dignity). To
pull down one’s facade (a front you put up to hide real emotions). An
animal’s organ that’s so important to its existence. While it’s a
survival tool of consumption, breathing and stimulation of its senses,
it’s also become one of the most vulnerable body part for an organism. A
variety of muscle contractions and nerve twitches have made it, so
that’s easy to read one’s intentions or thoughts, through the emotions
one is emitting. In turn, this allows cunning opportunistic predators to
read their prey and attack them when they least expect it. The face has
now become a communication tool. Are you comfortable, scared, happy,
tired, or perhaps diseased? Are you uncomfortable, angry, assertive,
sad, or healthy? Your face speaks volumes. Before we read words or
decoded voices, we in fact had the 1.0 hardware of communication. Facial
expressions.</p>
<h3 id="linguistic-semiotics-and-semantics">Linguistic Semiotics and
Semantics</h3>
<p>As Roland Barthes, argues within semiology there’s different
components in the communication of codified visuals. He argues that
there’s a messenger and a receiver. The messenger who emits a code, in
whatever visual form, and a receiver, who receives a codified visual
image. This code will be interpreted and decoded to make further
actions. No wonder why words associated with our face, such as,
impressive or expressive have made it into different languages. It’s
exactly that physical exchange of information that the face has been
facilitating. Impression and expression. Inhaling and exhaling. Winking
and seeing. Singing and hearing. Of course, we as a species have
understood this game of communication for a while now. Otherwise, we
wouldn’t have been here today, hasn’t it been for our survival skills.
We’ve noticed that other than just reading a face you can also ‘write’ a
face, in other words, we know how to manipulate the expression of true
emotions in order to gain something from it. This thing to gain, might
be approval of a community around you, not sticking out to get picked on
or just to have power in negotiating.</p>
<h3 id="dramaturgy">Dramaturgy</h3>
<p>In sociology, above mentioned manipulation of communication is also
understood as part of Goffman Erving’s dramaturgical analysis. He argues
that face-to-face interactions between people are always an attempt to
control or guide the impression others make of them by manipulating
their setting, appearance and manner. At the same time, the other
individual is trying to form and obtain information about the other. We
are constantly performing our emotions, dependant on the society one was
raised in, what social occasion one is at, or simply to emphasise your
emotion to yourself. Therefore, I argue we have an innate and intimate
connection to the art of performance and theater. Our facial expressions
are in fact a theatrical and spectacular phenomenon. The Theatrics of
Face Reading what are the different rituals in the act of face reading?
Face reading, also known as physiognomy, is a cultural practice, that
requires a face reader (a shaman or fortune-teller), who interprets
facial features to give a peek into one’s future or personality traits.
The HR of the middle ages. Culturally biased opinions on beauty and
morality of course are embedded in these practices, which I’m not
arguing against; it’s a pseudoscience. However, my fascination stems
from the fact that it shows how much a person could be concerned about
one’s face. We want to control something that was given to us by mother
nature and seek deeper meaning in the materiality of our body. In fact,
physiognomy and shamanism are believed to be the primitive precedence of
current day Chinese Opera. If we focus on the performative aspect of
emoting with our face, we can even abridge this theory further into the
origins of theater. I’ll specifically focus on Peking opera and the
painted face still as a communication tool. In the Chinese canon of
operatic performances, we see a specifically signified layer of symbolic
face paint that tell a story to the audience, beyond the facial
performativity of the actor. This had a reason. In order to be
democratic and perform for anyone, even illiterate people (which was
most of people in the feudal Dynastic periods), the sung lyrics were not
the only way of expressing a narrative, but additional background
information, characterisation and archetyping was expressed through
aesthetic symbols on the face of the actor.</p>
<h3 id="the-performance--chinese-opera">The Performance — Chinese
Opera</h3>
<p>An art form that has never been unified or homogenised and has always
been developing over centuries of time amongst different genres and
localisations. That’s what Chinese Opera is. However, over the last
century, we’ve seen a big decrease of the performance of this Opera
style affected by a range of different factors. The opera form has
always been influenced by big historical events, such as the
proliferation of the art form during the Mongol rule in the Yuan
Dynasty, or the propagandising of the Opera during the Cultural
Revolution. Nowadays, the performance style has lost a lot of interest
from the younger generation, despite government funding. We see new ways
of adaptation of the opera, such as the digitisation of the stage, the
usage of social media as platform or the borrowing of contemporary
western theatre stage design, But also the usage of these Chinese
Operatic aesthetics in other forms of art, like fashion photoshoots,
games, tourism and films. I’m interested in the semiotic and semantic
structures that lay beneath the Chinese Opera. How can I as a graphic
designer use this skeleton of a living fossil, reappropriate it and
design my own Opera for it? Perhaps I can focus specifically on the face
make-up, since I’m worrying about the scope of the entire Opera. :::</p>
